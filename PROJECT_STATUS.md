## üåü Recent Enhancements

### Independent Monitor Client
The monitoring functionality has been extracted into a completely independent application:

**Before**: Monitor was one tab in the main GUI  
**After**: Monitor is a standalone application with its own window

**Benefits**:
- Can run multiple monitors simultaneously
- Dedicated, focused interface
- Better resource management
- Cleaner code separation
- Enhanced user experience

**New Features**:
- Automatic change detection with detailed diff
- Real-time statistics (checks, changes, slots, runtime)
- Color-coded logging (info, success, warning, error, change)
- Configurable check interval and duration
- Multi-day monitoring support

### NetworkClient Enhancement
Added timeout parameter support:
```python
def send_request(self, request_data: bytes, 
                retries: int = MAX_RETRIES,
                timeout: Optional[float] = None) -> Optional[bytes]:
```

This allows different timeout values for different operations (e.g., shorter timeout for monitoring).

### Full English Localization
- Removed all Chinese text from codebase
- Updated comments, logs, and UI text
- Improved international accessibility

## üéØ Design Goals Achieved

### ‚úÖ Distributed Systems Concepts
- Client-server architecture
- UDP communication protocol
- Custom marshalling/unmarshalling
- Network byte order handling
- Request-response pattern
- Timeout and retry mechanisms
- Idempotent vs non-idempotent operations

### ‚úÖ Software Engineering Practices

- Separation of concerns
- Code reusability (common modules)
- Clean interfaces
- Comprehensive documentation
- Build automation
- Version control ready

### ‚úÖ User Experience
- Multiple interface options (CLI, GUI, Monitor)
- Real-time feedback
- Error handling and validation
- Helpful error messages
- Easy-to-use commands

## üöÄ How to Use

### Quick Start (3 Terminals)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Server
make run

# Terminal 2: Start Main GUI Client
make run-gui

# Terminal 3: Start Independent Monitor
make run-monitor
```

### Testing Workflow

1. **Query**: Use GUI client to query availability
2. **Book**: Book a facility through GUI
3. **Monitor**: Watch the monitor client detect the change
4. **Verify**: Check that available slots decreased in monitor log
5. **Change/Cancel**: Modify or cancel booking
6. **Observe**: Monitor automatically detects and logs the change
